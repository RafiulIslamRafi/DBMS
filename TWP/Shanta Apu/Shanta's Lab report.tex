	\textbf{{\large Experiment No : 01}}\\ \\
	\textbf{{\large Name of The Experiment:}}\\
	 To study the characteristics of diode act as switch.\\ \\
	\textbf{{\large Objective:}}\\ Our Objective is to study the characteristics of a diode act as a switch.\\ \\
	\textbf{{\large Theory :}}\\ A diode can act as switch , let us consider the circuit of figure a and b. When +5v is applied the diode D id forward biased and conducts hence current flow through the diode and the light will be on.\\
	When 0 is applied the diode D is reversed biased and hence no current flow through the diode and light will be off.That is the diode is acting like a switch. \\

	\textbf{{\large Equipments:}}\\ 1.Bread Board\\ 2. Multimeter\\ 3. Connecting Wires\\4. One LED\\5. One rectifier doide(17SR140)etc\\ \\
	\textbf{{\large Procedure :}}\\ The working procedure is given below :\\1. Selecting one diode and one LED.\\2. Connecting the diode and LED as shown in figure.\\3. Connecting the input to power supply.The input voltage will be wither +5v or 0v.\\ \\
	
	\textbf{{\large Truth Table:}}\\The truth table is given below : \\
	\begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}||p{3cm}||}
		\hline
		\bf{Input}& \bf{Output} \\
		\hline
		0 & 1 \\
		\hline
		0 & 0\\
