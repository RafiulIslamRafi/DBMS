\begin{enumerate}
	\item[1.1] Objective:
	\begin{center}
		Web Mining plays an important role in the e-commerce era. Web mining is the integration of web traf?c with other traditional business data like sales automaton system, inventory management, accounting, customer pro?le database, and e-commerce databases to enable the discovery of business co-relations and trends.(as de?ned in 1.1.1):

\item[1.1.1] Definition:
\begin{center}
	Web Mining: Incustomerrelationshipmanagement(CRM),Webminingistheintegration of information gathered by traditional data mining methodologies and techniques withinformationgatheredovertheWorldWideWeb. (Miningmeansextractingsomething useful or valuable from a baser substance, such as mining gold from the earth.) Web mining is used to understand customer behavior, evaluate the effectiveness of a particularWebsite,andhelpquantifythesuccessofamarketingcampaign.[Reference1]\\
	There are three general classes of information that can be discovered by web mining\vspace{0.5cm}:\\
	1. Web activity, from server logs and Web browser activity tracking.\\ 2. Web graph, from links between pages, people and other data. Web content, for the data found on Web pages and inside of documents.\\ 3. Web graph, from links between pages, people and other data. Web content, for the data found on Web pages and inside of documents.
	At Scale Unlimited we focus on the last one ? extracting value from web pages and other documents found on the web.

\item[1.2] Methodology:
\begin{center}
	The system basically deals with web con?guration on over network, the web divides variousdomainsforhostingandsupportingn-numberofwebagainstvirus,spamandhackers, web manager have to analyze visualization structure of webs for manipulating access details and graph structure for sorting process, when data transfer over network it has to privilege data by encoding and it has to Proactive management support that continually
